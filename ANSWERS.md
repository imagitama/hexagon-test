> The reasons why you have selected your approach and why you rejected other possible
solutions.

I chose to write my own algorithm because I believed part of this test was to challenge myself and to assess my techical ability.
There are packages and code snippets out there to achieve the same result however I avoided them for the above reason.

I chose to style using Emotion because it is a very good modern way to style a React app. I chose TypeScript because I think type safety is very important. I chose Enzyme as it has a great API for mounting and asserting React components in Jest.

> A test plan.

Written [here](./TEST-STRATEGY.md).

> An interface to allow the application to be tested interactively. This can take the form of
command line input or a graphical user interface. The application should accept input as
a string.

This app.

> Supporting files for testing, such as a documentation, working executable, source files,
test harnesses, and solution or project files.

All tests are written alongside the deliverable code. Code is self-documenting where possible however some documentation is written eg. this README.
